# Minecraft

This is a Minecraft clone that I have been creating. I made all of the textures.

The releases section has builds.

# Dependencies
It uses GLFW for the window and GLAD to load the OpenGl functions. It also uses GLM for the math, a library called FastNoise is included but isn't used and stb_image is used to load textures.
